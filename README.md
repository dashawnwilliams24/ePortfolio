### Welcome to my ePortfolio. Hello My name is Da’Shawn Williams. I served 8 years in the navy as a culinary specialist. I started as a cook on watch where I was just responsible for the products I was assigned for the day, and cleaning  after that I became the kitchen supervisor and I was in charge of 11 people and making sure the operation ran smoothly while maintaining good sanitation practices.  I've been responsible for food inventory and I've also been the QA for the operations paper and conducted monthly audits.  While on shore duty I signed up for a  computer user specialist boot camp with ACI Learning that included training in ITIL 4, A+, Network+  and Security+.  I am  really excited for the opportunity we've been given.
